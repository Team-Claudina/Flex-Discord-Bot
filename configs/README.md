# Config Dir

## Modify

The files in this directory control the majority of the easily
moddable settings in this project.

Do not change the default config files in the sub dir named `defaults`.
They have no effect on the function of this bot.

If there are no files with trailing `_config.py` in this directory
or any other problems please refer below or create an issue on our github
@[Flex Discord Bot Issues](https://github.com/GreyStinger/Flex-Discord-Bot/issues)


#### Missing files?

If you don't see anything here please run either `configure.bat` 
or `configure.sh` in the project root.

Otherwise copy the default embed files out of the defaults dir
and remove the railing `_default` from them.
